# PyFlame
This is an IDE coded in python, it is work in progress at the moment and doesnt actually have any real uses.

## What I learned
 - Complex regular expressions were needed for syntax highlighting
 - Planning ahead by creating modular methods and functions which can be reused

## How to use it
```buildoutcfg
git clone https://github.com/ravenkls/pyflame.git
cd pyflame
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Todo list
- [x] syntax highlighting
- [x] auto indentation
- [x] highlighting other selected words
- [x] save + load files
- [x] execute file inside IDE
- [x] multiple files in tabs open
- [x] project manager (e.g. folder structure)
- [ ] intellisense
- [ ] better splash screen on welcome 

cant think of anything else at the moment
