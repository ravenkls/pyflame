This is an IDE coded in python, it is work in progress at the moment and doesnt actually have any real uses.

## How to download it
```buildoutcfg

- [x] highlighting other selected words
- [x] save + load files
- [x] execute file inside IDE
- [x] multiple files in tabs open
- [x] project manager (e.g. folder structure)
